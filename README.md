# Data Cleaning Airbnb

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective
The goal of this project was to clean and preprocess the dataset to make it ready for analysis. The dataset contained missing values, and extreme outliers that required systematic cleaning.

## ðŸ”§ Steps Performed
1. Imported and explored the dataset (shape, summary statistics, null values).
2. Handled missing values using appropriate methods (drop/fill).
3. Removed irrelevant features like id,name, host_id etc.
4. Checked for and treated outliers in features like `price`, `minimum_nights`, and `reviews_per_month`.
5. Created a cleaned dataset ready for analysis.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Outcome
- Reduced dataset inconsistencies and noise.
- Created a final cleaned dataset (`cleaned.csv`) ready for visualization and machine learning tasks.
